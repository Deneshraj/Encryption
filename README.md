## Working of New Encryption Technique
This encryption technique is a set of simple encryption methods which will be encrypt the given
data. The given string is convert into corresponding ASCII characters and the resultant is stored
in a float array. This array is where a simple mathematical calculations such as the ones given in the Encryption.java File. The encryption is very much faster and is simple.

### Please Contribute and submit your reviews about this new Encryption Technique, and also your suggestions.

### How to use it:
# Step 1:
    Compile the java programs with the following command

    javac *.java

# Step 2:
    Run the EncMain.java as
    
    java EncMain


## If you want to test the working, just press y when it asks if you want to test, and pass the array as input, since our encryption methods only performs the operations in the array and not on the strings.

### Things you can Encrypt.
    1. Strings.
    2. File.

Right now, if you encrypt the string and you try to decrypt, copying the encrypted chinese text, then it won't work, as there are conversion from letters to text and text to letters, which causes some error in decrypting.
